\end{center}
The system will be implemented in layered architecture. It is to reduce complexity for each layer.
\begin{description}
	\item[Database] Database layer will be postgreSQL database system to manage the data persistence storage.
	\item[Database Wrapper] Database Wrapper is a set of modules implemented to map data from database into memory with predefined functions to manipulate these data.
	\item[Business Logic] Business Logic is a set of modules implemented to control the access to the data retreived by Database Wrapper and determine what feedback data shall be given to user interface.
	\item[User Interface] User Interface is a set of modules implemented to interact with user input, displaying the view instructed by Business Logic.
\end{description}

\subsection{Views}
\subsubsection{Common User Views}
All users shall be able to see
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a list of titles of all operational plans maintained by the system.
	\item a list of all objectives for a particular finaicial year.
	\item details about a particular objective with a list of all strategies for this objective.
	\item details about a particular strategy with a list of all actions for this strategy.
	\item details about a particular action with a list of all of its planned outcome for this action with a list of the same action in previous plans if any.
	\item details about a particular task with a list of all of its progress reports for this task plus the a list of the same task in previous plans if any.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Administrator}
Administratro can have all views that veto users have plus
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A view for managing users
	\item A list of all editing objectives/strategies
\end{enumerate}
