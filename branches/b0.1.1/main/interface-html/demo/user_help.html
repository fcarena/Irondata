	<h4>Getting Started</h4>
	<p>Firstly, remember that if you are not the administrator, you may have limited access to some features of the program.</p>
	<p>This will take you to the main reporting screen from where you will be able to choose from the two main functions, Reports , Administration or logout of the system.</p>
	<p>The first thing that you will want to do when you login is to change the database that you are working with. All templates and reports are specific to a single database. This means if you can't find the report you are looking for, try changing your current database. To do this click on the <em>'change'</em> link under the <em>Current Database</em> heading on the side panel. Select the database you require from the dropdown and click <em>Change Database</em></p>

	<h4>Reports Function</h4>
	<strong>What can you do?</strong>: The versatility of the Golf Report Generator means that the user has a wide range of options within this section. From the left of the screen you can see under the current database, any report templates, previously saved, which are available to your level of access. You will also notice three other headings under the current database. These are the three different types of reports you can view and save. They are:</p>

	<p><strong>Trend</strong>: This feature allows the user to view the data available over a period or several periods of time. The user can create a new trend report by clicking <em>New Trend Report</em>.</p>

	<p><strong>Table</strong>: This feature allows the user to view the data available in relation to other data for example people's grade in relation to their college. The user can create a new table report by clicking <em>New Table Report</em>.</p>

	<p><strong>List</strong>: This feature allows the user to view the data available in the form of listed columns. The user can create a new list report by clicking <em>New List Report</em>.</p>

	<p class='helpbox'><table border=0><tr><td>Save</td><td><img src='images/help1.png'></td></tr><tr><td>PDF</td><td><img src='images/pdf.png'></td></tr></table></p>
	<h4>Pregenerated Reports</h4>
	When you click on an existing report, the 'saved reports' screen is shown. Each saved report has two options next to it they are <em>View</em> and <em>Delete</em>. Clicking on view will allow the user to view the report on screen or alternatively by clicking the now appeared pdf icon, the user can save the report in a .pdf file format for exporting. By clicking the <em>Delete</em> text, the user can delete a previously generated report.</p>

	<p>After either creating a new report or loading a previously saved one you will now notice on the right hand side of the screen, several icons.</p>

	<p class='helpbox'><table border=0><tr><td>Run Report</td><td><img src='images/run.png'></td></tr><tr><td>New Template</td><td><img src='images/new.png'></td></tr><tr><td>Edit Template</td><td><img src='images/edit.png'></td></tr><tr><td>Delete Template</td><td><img src='images/delete.png'></td></tr></table></p>

	<h4>Run Report</h4>
	<p>Clicking the run icon will allow the user to generate a new report from the report template. The user will then be able to view this new report or save it for future reference. The time for generating the report can vary due to the complexity of a given report.</p>

	<h4>New Templates</h4>
	<p>Actually clicking the new icon is the same as clicking on the new report option on the left hand side of the screen though it will choose the report type of whichever template you happen to be in at the time. It allows the user to create a report template for generating reports from the available data.</p>

	<h4>Edit Template</h4>
	<p>Clicking on the edit icon will enable the user to edit an existing report template. The options are the same as with the new report screen. </p>

	<h4>Delete</h4>
	<p>Clicking on the delete icon allows the user to delete a report template as opposed to a specific report. Be certain that this is what you wish to do because this action is irreversible. In accordance clicking on this icon will generate a confirmation window while informing you of the fact that the action is irreversible.</p>
