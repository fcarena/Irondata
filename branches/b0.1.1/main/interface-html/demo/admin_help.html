<h2>User administration and access control. </h2>";
<p>The administration functions allows administrator to create new users, control the availability of data through permission limitations and to import new databases for the report templates. Again on the left hand side of the screen you will note two headings. These are Users and Databases.</p>
<h4>Users</h4>
<p>Under this option, the user can see a list of available user profiles or choose to create a new user by clicking <em>New User</em>. Doing so opens the Create New User window.</p>
<p>To create a new user, simply type in a username, a password and then the password again in the fields provided.</p>
<p>Now select the access permissions for the new user by checking the tick boxes of the rights you wish them to have and which data fields you want them to be able to access or modify. Simply check the Admin tick box if you wish to give them full access. Once you are happy with your choices, click the <em>Create New User</em> button.</p>

<h4>Databases</h4>
<p>Again the user can see a list of databases available or create a new one. Clicking the (insert add new database text) text will open up the add database window. To add a new database, fill in the Database name and PostgreSql name fields and then click the <em>Add/Edit database</em> button. </p>
<p>Now all the tables and columns within that database are displayed. Each one (when editing the database) has a <em>Foreign Key</em> texbox and <em>Selectable</em> checkbox. The foreign key field must be in the format of tablename:columnname and allows foreign keys to be specified to aid in the auto joining of tables. If selectable is checked then when that column is selected as a constraint (is only) a drop down box of values will appear, making creating constraints easier.</p>
